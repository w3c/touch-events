        By publishing this Recommendation, W3C expects that the functionality
        specified in this Touch Interface Recommendation will not be affected by
        changes to HTML5 or Web IDL as those specifications proceed to
        Recommendation.

        The WG has completed and approved this specification's
        <a href="http://w3c-test.org/webevents/tests/touch-events-v1/approved/">Test Suite</a>
        and created an
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/wiki/TEv1ImplReport">
        Implementation Report</a> that shows that two or more independent implementations
        pass each test.

        This version of the specification includes fixes and improvements to
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/">Level 1</a>, and
        incorporates the features previously published as
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events-extensions/">Touch Event
        Extentions</a>.

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification defines a set of low-level events that
        represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface,
        and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM
        elements displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it
        (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays). It also addresses
        pen-tablet devices, such as drawing tablets, with consideration toward
        stylus capabilities.

    <section id='introduction' class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        User Agents that run on terminals which provide touch input to use web
        applications typically use interpreted mouse events to allow users
        to access interactive web applications. However, these interpreted
        events, being normalized data based on the physical touch input, tend
        to have limitations on delivering the intended user experience.
        Additionally, it is not possible to handle concurrent input regardless
        of device capability, due to constraints of mouse events: both
        system level limitations and legacy compatibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, native applications are capable of handling both cases with
        the provided system APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification provides a solution to this problem by
        specifying interfaces to allow web applications to directly handle touch
        events, and multiple touch points for capable devices.
      </p>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements
        the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        WindowProxy is defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>


        <h3 id="webidl-conform">WebIDL Conformance</h3>
        <p>
          The IDL blocks in this specification are conforming IDL
          fragments as defined by the WebIDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
        </p>

        <p>
          A conforming user agent must also be a
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#dfn-conforming-ECMAScript-implementation">conforming
          ECMAScript implementation</a> of this IDL fragments in this specification, with
          the following exception:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#es-attributes">section 4.4.6
            of Web IDL</a> requires that IDL attributes are reflected as
            accessor properties on interface prototype objects. Instead of
            this, the user agent may reflect IDL attributes as data properties
            on the platform objects that implement the relevant interface.
            These data properties must have the same behavior when getting and
            setting as would be exhibited when invoking the getter and setter
            of the accessor properties on the platform object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Both ways of reflecting IDL attributes allow for simply getting
        and setting the property on the platform object to work. For example, given a
        <code>Touch</code> object <code>aTouch</code>, evaluating <code>aTouch.target</code>
        would return the <code>EventTarget</code> for the <code>Touch</code> object. If the
        user agent implements IDL attributes as accessor properties, then the property access
        invokes the getter which returns the <code>EventTarget</code>. If the user agent implements
        IDL attributes as data properties on the platform object with the same behavior as
        would be found with the accessor properties, then the object would appear to have an
        own property named <code>target</code> whose value is an <code>EventTarget</code> object,
        and the property access would return this value.
      </p>

        <a><code>touchmove</code></a>, and <a><code>touchcancel</code></a> event types.
        <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a> objects are immutable; after one is created and

        The <dfn>TouchEventInit</dfn> dictionary is used by the

        It inherits from the <code>EventModifierInit</code> dictionary defined in
        [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]]. The steps for constructing an event are
        defined in [[!DOM4]]. See the <a href="#firing-a-synthetic-touchevent-from-script"

        <p>User agents should ensure that all <a><code>Touch</code></a> objects available from a given
        <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a> are all associated to the same document that the <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a> was dispatched
        to. To implement this, user agents should maintain a notion of the current 
        <em>touch-active</em> document. On first touch, this is set to the target document
        where the touch was created. When all active touch points are released, the
        <em>touch-active</em> document is cleared. All <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a>s are dispatched to the
        current <em>touch-active</em> document, and each <a><code>Touch</code></a> object it contains refers
        only to DOM elements (and co-ordinates) in that document. If a touch starts entirely
        outside the currently <em>touch-active</em> document, then it is ignored entirely. </p>

      <h2>Interaction with Mouse Events and <code>click</code></h2>
      <p>
        The user agent may dispatch both touch events and (for compatibility with web content not designed for touch) mouse events
        [[!DOM-LEVEL-2-EVENTS]] in response to the same user input. If the
        user agent dispatches both touch events and mouse events in response to
        a single user action, then the <a><code>touchstart</code></a> event type must be
        dispatched before any mouse event types for that action.
        If <a><code>touchstart</code></a>, <a><code>touchmove</code></a>, or <a><code>touchend</code></a>
        are <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">canceled</a>, the user agent should not dispatch any mouse
        event that would be a consequential result of the prevented touch
        event.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If a Web application can process touch events, it can <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">cancel</a> the events,
        and no corresponding mouse events would need to be dispatched by the
        user agent. If the Web application is not specifically written for
        touch input devices, it will react to the subsequent mouse events instead.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        User agents will typically dispatch mouse and click events only for single-finger activation gestures (like tap and long press). Gestures involving movement of the touch point or multi-touch interactions – with two or more
        <a href="#dfn-active-touch-point">active touch points</a> – will usually only generate touch events.
      </p>

      <p id="click-events">
        If the user agent interprets a sequence of touch events as a tap gesture,
        then it should dispatch <code>mousemove</code>, <code>mousedown</code>,
        <code>mouseup</code>, and <code>click</code> events (in that order) at the location
        of the <a><code>touchend</code></a> event for the corresponding touch input. If the
        contents of the document have changed during processing of the touch
        events, then the user agent may dispatch the mouse events to a
        different target than the touch events.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default actions and ordering of any further touch and mouse events
        are implementation-defined, except as specified elsewhere.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>The activation of an element (e.g., in some implementations, a tap)
        would typically produce the following event sequence
        (though this may vary slightly, depending on specific user agent behavior):</p>
        <ol data-class="note-list">
            <li><code>touchstart</code></li>
            <li>Zero or more <code>touchmove</code> events, depending on movement of the finger</li>
            <li><code>touchend</code></li>
            <li><code>mousemove</code> <small>(for compatibility with legacy mouse-specific code)</small></li>
            <li><code>mousedown</code></li>
            <li><code>mouseup</code></li>
            <li><code>click</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If, however, either the <code>touchstart</code>, <code>touchmove</code> or <code>touchend</code>
        event has been <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">canceled</a> during this interaction, no mouse or
        click events will be fired, and the resulting sequence of events would simply be:
        </p><ol data-class="note-list">
            <li><code>touchstart</code></li>
            <li>Zero or more <code>touchmove</code> events, depending on movement of the finger</li> 
            <li><code>touchend</code></li>
        </ol>           
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Even if a user agent supports Touch Events, this does not necessarily mean that a touchscreen is the only input mechanism available to users. Particularly in the case of touch-enabled laptops, or traditional "touch only" devices (such as phones and tablets) with paired external input devices, users may use the touchscreen in conjunction with a trackpad, mouse or keyboard. For this reason, developers should avoid binding event listeners with "either touch or mouse/keyboard" conditional code, as this results in sites/application that become touch-exclusive, preventing users from being able to use any other input mechanism.</p>
<pre class="example"><code>
// conditional "touch OR mouse/keyboard" event binding
// DON'T DO THIS, as it makes interactions touch-exclusive
// on devices that have both touch and mouse/keyboard

if ('ontouchstart' in window) {
  // set up event listeners for touch
  target.addEventListener('touchend', ...);
  ...
} else {
  // set up event listeners for mouse/keyboard
  target.addEventListener('click', ...);
  ...
}
</code></pre>
      <p>Instead, developers should handle different forms of input concurrently.</p>
<pre class="example"><code>
// concurrent "touch AND mouse/keyboard" event binding

// set up event listeners for touch
target.addEventListener('touchend', function(e) {
  // prevent compatibility mouse events and click
  e.preventDefault();
  ...
});
...

// set up event listeners for mouse/keyboard
target.addEventListener('click', ...);
...
</code></pre>      
        <p>To avoid processing the same interaction twice for touch (once for the touch event, and once for the compatibility mouse events), developers should make sure to <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">cancel</a> the touch event, suppressing the generation of any further mouse or click events. Alternatively, see the <a href="http://wicg.github.io/InputDeviceCapabilities/">InputDeviceCapabilities API</a> for a way to detect mouse events that were generated as a result of touch events.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>active touch point</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A <a>touch point</a> which is currently on the screen and is being
          tracked by the user agent. The touch point becomes active when the
          user agent first dispatches a <a><code>touchstart</code></a> event indicating its
          appearance. It ceases to be active after the user agent dispatches a
          <a><code>touchend</code></a> or <a><code>touchcancel</code></a> event indicating that the
          touch point is removed from the surface or no longer tracked.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>touch point</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The coordinate point at which a pointer (e.g finger or stylus)
          intersects the target surface of an interface. This may apply to a
          finger touching a touch-screen, or an digital pen writing on a piece
          of paper.
        </dd>
        
        <dt><dfn>canceled event</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          An event whose default action was prevented by means of <code>preventDefault()</code>,
          returning <code>false</code> in an event handler, or other means as defined by
          [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] and [[!HTML5]].
