touch-events
============

This is the document repository for the [Touch Events Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/touchevents/).

# Branches

Currently, this repo has two branches of note:

1. gh-pages - this branch is active. It contains the [Touch Events Level 2](http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/) editors draft (which contains all the changes from an old v1-errata branch and the [Touch Events Extension Working Group Note](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events-extensions/)).
2. v1 - this branch is it not active. (It was the working branch for the v1 specification.)

# Process for Landing Changes

Per the group's [2015-Jan-27 agreement](http://www.w3.org/2015/01/27-touchevents-minutes.html#item05), the following process is used to review and approve Pull Requests:

* Submit a pull request and post the PR's link to the [public-touchevents](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-touchevents/) e-mail list asking for feedback.
* As soon as one of the listed spec editors approves the PR it can be merged.
* If there's debate over a PR that has already landed, it may be reverted until consensus is reached.

## Tests

For normative changes, a corresponding
[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,
both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should
not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why
and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow
up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.
