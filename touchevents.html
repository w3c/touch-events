     By publishing this Recommendation, W3C expects that the functionality
     specified in this Touch Interface Recommendation will not be affected by
     changes to HTML5 or Web IDL as those specifications proceed to
     Recommendation.

     The WG has completed and approved this specification's 
     <a href="http://w3c-test.org/webevents/tests/touch-events-v1/approved/">Test Suite</a> 
     and created an 
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/wiki/TEv1ImplReport">
     Implementation Report</a> that shows that two or more independent implementations 
     pass each test.
    </section>

    <section id='abstract'>
      The Touch Events specification defines a set of low-level events that
      represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface,
      and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM
      elements displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it
      (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays).  It also addresses
      pen-tablet devices, such as drawing tablets, with consideration toward
      stylus capabilities.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        User Agents that run on terminals which provide touch input to use web
        applications typically use interpreted mouse events to allow users
        to access interactive web applications. However, these interpreted
        events, being normalized data based on the physical touch input, tend
        to have limitations on delivering the intended user experience.
        Additionally, it is not possible to handle concurrent input regardless
        of device capability, due to constraints of mouse events: both
        system level limitations and legacy compatibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, native applications are capable of handling both cases with
        the provided system APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification provides a solution to this problem by
        specifying interfaces to allow web applications to directly handle touch
        events, and multiple touch points for capable devices.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        The W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">
        Protocols and Formats Working Group</a> created a non-normative document 
        that includes a mapping of hardware events (e.g. keyboard events) to touch 
        events. For more information see 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/wiki/Touch_Events_Accessibility_Mapping">

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements
        the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        WindowProxy is defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>


        <h3 id="webidl-conform">WebIDL Conformance</h3>
        <p>
          The IDL blocks in this specification are conforming IDL 
          fragments as defined by the WebIDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
        </p>

        <p>
          A conforming Web Events user agent must also be a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#dfn-conforming-ECMAScript-implementation">conforming ECMAScript implementation</a> of this IDL fragments in this specification, with the following exception:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#es-attributes">section 4.4.6
            of Web IDL</a> requires that IDL attributes are reflected as
            accessor properties on interface prototype objects.  Instead of
            this, the user agent may reflect IDL attributes as data properties
            on the platform objects that implement the relevant interface.
            These data properties must have the same behavior when getting and
            setting as would be exhibited when invoking the getter and setter
            of the accessor properties on the platform object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Both ways of reflecting IDL attributes allow for simply getting and setting the property on the platform object to work.  For example, given a Touch object aTouch, evaluating aTouch.target would return the EventTarget for the Touch object.  If the user agent implements IDL attributes as accessor properties, then the property access invokes the getter which returns the EventTarget.  If the user agent implements IDL attributes as data properties on the platform object with the same behavior as would be found with the accessor properties, then the object would appear to have an own property named "target" whose value is an EventTarget object, and the property access would return this value.

       <h2>TouchEvent Implementer's Note</h2>

        <p>User agents should ensure that all <a>Touch</a> objects available from a given 
        <a>TouchEvent</a> are all associated to the same document that the <a>TouchEvent</a> was dispatched 
        to. To implement this, user agents should maintain a notion of the current 
        <em>touch-active</em> document. On first touch, this is set to the target document 
        where the touch was created. When all active touch points are released, the 
        <em>touch-active</em> document is cleared. All <a>TouchEvent</a>s are dispatched to the 
        current <em>touch-active</em> document, and each <a>Touch</a> object it contains refers 
        only to DOM elements (and co-ordinates) in that document. If a touch starts entirely 
        outside the currently <em>touch-active</em> document, then it is ignored entirely. </p>

        event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when the user
          places a <a>touch point</a> on the touch surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The target of this event must be an <a>Element</a>.  If the touch
          point is within a frame, the event should be dispatched to an element
          in the <a>child browsing context</a> of that frame.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the <a>preventDefault</a> method is called on this event, it
          should prevent any default actions caused by any touch events
          associated with the same <a>active touch point</a>, including mouse
          events or scrolling.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="event-touchend">The <dfn class="event">touchend</dfn> event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when the user
          removes a <a>touch point</a> from the touch surface, also including
          cases where the touch point physically leaves the touch surface, such
          as being dragged off of the screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>target</a> of this event must be the same <a>Element</a> on 
		  which the <a>touch point</a> started when it was first
          placed on the surface, even if the <a>touch point</a> has since moved
          outside the interactive area of the <a>target</a> element.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>touch point</a> or points that were removed must be included
          in the <a>changedTouches</a> attribute of the <a>TouchEvent</a>, and
          must not be included in the <a>touches</a> and <a>targetTouches</a>
          attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this event is cancelled, any sequence of touch events that
          includes this event must not be <a href="#click-events">interpreted
          as a click</a>.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="event-touchmove">The <dfn class="event">touchmove</dfn> event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when the user
          moves a <a>touch point</a> along the touch surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>target</a> of this event must be the same <a>Element</a> on 
		  which the <a>touch point</a> started when it was first
          placed on the surface, even if the <a>touch point</a> has since moved
          outside the interactive area of the <a>target</a> element.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that the rate at which the user agent sends <a>touchmove</a>
          events is implementation-defined, and may depend on hardware
          capabilities and other implementation details.
        </p>

        <p>
          A user agent should suppress the default action caused by
          any <a>touchmove</a> event until at least one <a>touchmove</a> event
          associated with the same <a>active touch point</a> is not
          cancelled. Whether the default action is suppressed
          for <a>touchmove</a> events after at least one <a>touchmove</a> event
          associated with the same <a>active touch point</a> is not cancelled is
          implementation dependent.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h3 id="event-touchcancel">The <dfn class="event">touchcancel</dfn> event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when a touch
          point has been disrupted in an implementation-specific manner, such as
          a synchronous event or action originating from the UA canceling the
          touch, or the touch point leaving the document window into a
          non-document area which is capable of handling user interactions.
          (e.g. The UA's native user interface, plug-ins)  A user agent may
          also dispatch this event type when the user places more <a>touch
          point</a>s on the touch surface than the device or implementation is
          configured to store, in which case the earliest <a>Touch</a> object
          in the <a>TouchList</a> should be removed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>target</a> of this event must be the same <a>Element</a> on 
		  which the <a>touch point</a> started when it was first
          placed on the surface, even if the <a>touch point</a> has since moved
          outside the interactive area of the <a>target</a> element.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>touch point</a> or points that were removed must be included
          in the <a>changedTouches</a> attribute of the <a>TouchEvent</a>, and
          must not be included in the <a>touches</a> and <a>targetTouches</a>

      <p class="note">
        Some user agents implement an initTouchEvent method as part of the
        <a>TouchEvent</a> interface.  When this method is available, scripts
        can use it to initialize the properties of a <a>TouchEvent</a> object,
        including its <a>TouchList</a> properties (which can be initialized
        with values returned from <a>createTouchList</a>).  The
        <a>initTouchEvent</a> method is not yet standardized, but it may appear
        in some form in a future specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mouse-events">
      <h2>Interaction with Mouse Events</h2>
      <p>
        The user agent may dispatch both touch events and mouse events
        [[!DOM-LEVEL-2-EVENTS]] in response to the same user input.  If the
        user agent dispatches both touch events and mouse events in response to
        a single user action, then the <a>touchstart</a> event type must be
        dispatched before any mouse event types for that action.  If the
        <a>preventDefault</a> method of <a>touchstart</a>, <a>touchmove</a>, or
        <a>touchend</a> is called, the user agent should not dispatch any mouse
        event that would be a consequential result of the the prevented touch
        event.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If a Web application can process touch events, it can intercept them, 
        and no corresponding mouse events would need to be dispatched by the 
        user agent. If the Web application is not specifically written for 
        touch input devices, it can react to the subsequent mouse events instead.
      </p>

      <p id="click-events">
        If the user agent intreprets a sequence of touch events as a click,
        then it should dispatch <a>mousemove</a>, <a>mousedown</a>,
        <a>mouseup</a>, and <a>click</a> events (in that order) at the location
        of the <a>touchend</a> event for the corresponding touch input.  If the
        contents of the document have changed during processing of the touch
        events, then the user agent may dispatch the mouse events to a
        different target than the touch events.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default actions and ordering of any further touch and mouse events
        are implementation-defined, except as specified elsewhere.

      <h2>Glossary</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>active touch point</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A <a>touch point</a> which is currently on the screen and is being
          tracked by the user agent.  The touch point becomes active when the
          user agent first dispatches a <a>touchstart</a> event indicating its
          appearance.  It ceases to be active after the user agent dispatches a
          <a>touchend</a> or <a>touchcancel</a> event indicating that the touch
          point is removed from the surface or no longer tracked.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>touch point</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The coordinate point at which a pointer (e.g finger or stylus)
          intersects the target surface of an interface.  This may apply to a
          finger touching a touch-screen, or an digital pen writing on a piece
          of paper.
        </dd>
        
        <dt><dfn>preventDefault</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          If a event is cancelable, the preventDefault method is used to signify
          that the event is to be canceled, and any default actions defined in the
          user agent as a result of this event, or consequential events from the
          canceled event will not occur. Calling this method on non-cancelable
          events will have no effect.
