        By publishing this Recommendation, W3C expects that the functionality
        specified in this Touch Interface Recommendation will not be affected by
        changes to HTML5 or Web IDL as those specifications proceed to
        Recommendation.

        The WG has completed and approved this specification's
        <a href="http://w3c-test.org/webevents/tests/touch-events-v1/approved/">Test Suite</a>
        and created an
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/wiki/TEv1ImplReport">
        Implementation Report</a> that shows that two or more independent implementations
        pass each test.

        This version of the specification includes fixes and improvements to
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/">Level 1</a>, and
        incorporates the features previously published as
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events-extensions/">Touch Event
        Extentions</a>.

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification defines a set of low-level events that
        represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface,
        and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM
        elements displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it
        (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays). It also addresses
        pen-tablet devices, such as drawing tablets, with consideration toward
        stylus capabilities.

    <section id='introduction' class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        User Agents that run on terminals which provide touch input to use web
        applications typically use interpreted mouse events to allow users
        to access interactive web applications. However, these interpreted
        events, being normalized data based on the physical touch input, tend
        to have limitations on delivering the intended user experience.
        Additionally, it is not possible to handle concurrent input regardless
        of device capability, due to constraints of mouse events: both
        system level limitations and legacy compatibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, native applications are capable of handling both cases with
        the provided system APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification provides a solution to this problem by
        specifying interfaces to allow web applications to directly handle touch
        events, and multiple touch points for capable devices.
      </p>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements
        the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        WindowProxy is defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>


        <h3 id="webidl-conform">WebIDL Conformance</h3>
        <p>
          The IDL blocks in this specification are conforming IDL
          fragments as defined by the WebIDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
        </p>

        <p>
          A conforming Web Events user agent must also be a
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#dfn-conforming-ECMAScript-implementation">conforming
          ECMAScript implementation</a> of this IDL fragments in this specification, with
          the following exception:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#es-attributes">section 4.4.6
            of Web IDL</a> requires that IDL attributes are reflected as
            accessor properties on interface prototype objects. Instead of
            this, the user agent may reflect IDL attributes as data properties
            on the platform objects that implement the relevant interface.
            These data properties must have the same behavior when getting and
            setting as would be exhibited when invoking the getter and setter
            of the accessor properties on the platform object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Both ways of reflecting IDL attributes allow for simply getting
        and setting the property on the platform object to work. For example, given a
        <code>Touch</code> object <code>aTouch</code>, evaluating <code>aTouch.target</code>
        would return the <code>EventTarget</code> for the <code>Touch</code> object. If the
        user agent implements IDL attributes as accessor properties, then the property access
        invokes the getter which returns the <code>EventTarget</code>. If the user agent implements
        IDL attributes as data properties on the platform object with the same behavior as
        would be found with the accessor properties, then the object would appear to have an
        own property named <code>target</code> whose value is an <code>EventTarget</code> object,
        and the property access would return this value.

          If the ellipse described by radiusX and radiusY is circular, then
          rotationAngle has no effect. The user agent may use <code>0</code> as
          the value in this case, or it may use any other value in the allowed

      <h2>Interaction with Mouse Events and <code>click</code></h2>
      <p>
        The user agent may dispatch both touch events and mouse events
        [[!DOM-LEVEL-2-EVENTS]] in response to the same user input. If the
        user agent dispatches both touch events and mouse events in response to
        a single user action, then the <a><code>touchstart</code></a> event type must be

        If <a><code>touchstart</code></a>, <a><code>touchmove</code></a>, or <a><code>touchend</code></a>
        are <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">canceled</a>, the user agent should not dispatch any mouse
        event that would be a consequential result of the the prevented touch
        event.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If a Web application can process touch events, it can <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">cancel</a> the events,

        touch input devices, it will react to the subsequent mouse events instead.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        User agents will typically dispatch mouse and click events when there is only a single
        <a>active touch point</a>. Multi-touch interactions – involving two or more
        <a href="#dfn-active-touch-point">active touch points</a> – will usually only generate touch events.
      </p>

      <p id="click-events">
        If the user agent interprets a sequence of touch events as a click,
        then it should dispatch <a><code>mousemove</code></a>, <a><code>mousedown</code></a>,
        <a><code>mouseup</code></a>, and <a><code>click</code></a> events (in that order) at the location
        of the <a><code>touchend</code></a> event for the corresponding touch input. If the
        contents of the document have changed during processing of the touch
        events, then the user agent may dispatch the mouse events to a
        different target than the touch events.
