        By publishing this Recommendation, W3C expects that the functionality
        specified in this Touch Interface Recommendation will not be affected by
        changes to HTML5 or Web IDL as those specifications proceed to
        Recommendation.

        The WG has completed and approved this specification's
        <a href="http://w3c-test.org/webevents/tests/touch-events-v1/approved/">Test Suite</a>
        and created an
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/wiki/TEv1ImplReport">
        Implementation Report</a> that shows that two or more independent implementations
        pass each test.

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification defines a set of low-level events that
        represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface,
        and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM
        elements displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it
        (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays). It also addresses
        pen-tablet devices, such as drawing tablets, with consideration toward
        stylus capabilities.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        User Agents that run on terminals which provide touch input to use web
        applications typically use interpreted mouse events to allow users
        to access interactive web applications. However, these interpreted
        events, being normalized data based on the physical touch input, tend
        to have limitations on delivering the intended user experience.
        Additionally, it is not possible to handle concurrent input regardless
        of device capability, due to constraints of mouse events: both
        system level limitations and legacy compatibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, native applications are capable of handling both cases with
        the provided system APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification provides a solution to this problem by
        specifying interfaces to allow web applications to directly handle touch
        events, and multiple touch points for capable devices.
      </p>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements
        the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        WindowProxy is defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>


        <h3 id="webidl-conform">WebIDL Conformance</h3>
        <p>
          The IDL blocks in this specification are conforming IDL
          fragments as defined by the WebIDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
        </p>

        <p>
          A conforming Web Events user agent must also be a
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#dfn-conforming-ECMAScript-implementation">conforming
          ECMAScript implementation</a> of this IDL fragments in this specification, with
          the following exception:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#es-attributes">section 4.4.6
            of Web IDL</a> requires that IDL attributes are reflected as
            accessor properties on interface prototype objects. Instead of
            this, the user agent may reflect IDL attributes as data properties
            on the platform objects that implement the relevant interface.
            These data properties must have the same behavior when getting and
            setting as would be exhibited when invoking the getter and setter
            of the accessor properties on the platform object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Both ways of reflecting IDL attributes allow for simply getting
        and setting the property on the platform object to work. For example, given a
        <code>Touch</code> object <code>aTouch</code>, evaluating <code>aTouch.target</code>
        would return the <code>EventTarget</code> for the <code>Touch</code> object. If the
        user agent implements IDL attributes as accessor properties, then the property access
        invokes the getter which returns the <code>EventTarget</code>. If the user agent implements
        IDL attributes as data properties on the platform object with the same behavior as
        would be found with the accessor properties, then the object would appear to have an
        own property named <code>target</code> whose value is an <code>EventTarget</code> object,
        and the property access would return this value.

        <p>User agents should ensure that all <a><code>Touch</code></a> objects available from a given
        <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a> are all associated to the same document that the <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a> was dispatched
        to. To implement this, user agents should maintain a notion of the current 
        <em>touch-active</em> document. On first touch, this is set to the target document
        where the touch was created. When all active touch points are released, the
        <em>touch-active</em> document is cleared. All <a><code>TouchEvent</code></a>s are dispatched to the
        current <em>touch-active</em> document, and each <a><code>Touch</code></a> object it contains refers
        only to DOM elements (and co-ordinates) in that document. If a touch starts entirely
        outside the currently <em>touch-active</em> document, then it is ignored entirely. </p>

          (e.g. The UA's native user interface, plug-ins)  A user agent may

    <section id="mouse-events">
      <h2>Interaction with Mouse Events and <code>click</code></h2>
      <p>
        The user agent may dispatch both touch events and mouse events
        [[!DOM-LEVEL-2-EVENTS]] in response to the same user input. If the
        user agent dispatches both touch events and mouse events in response to
        a single user action, then the <a><code>touchstart</code></a> event type must be
        dispatched before any mouse event types for that action.
        If <a><code>touchstart</code></a>, <a><code>touchmove</code></a>, or <a><code>touchend</code></a>
        are <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">canceled</a>, the user agent should not dispatch any mouse
        event that would be a consequential result of the the prevented touch
        event.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If a Web application can process touch events, it can <a href="#dfn-canceled-event">cancel</a> the events,
        and no corresponding mouse events would need to be dispatched by the
        user agent. If the Web application is not specifically written for
        touch input devices, it will react to the subsequent mouse events instead.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        User agents will typically dispatch mouse and click events when there is only a single
        <a>active touch point</a>. Multi-touch interactions – involving two or more
        <a href="#dfn-active-touch-point">active touch points</a> – will usually only generate touch events.
      </p>

      <p id="click-events">
        If the user agent interprets a sequence of touch events as a click,
        then it should dispatch <a><code>mousemove</code></a>, <a><code>mousedown</code></a>,
        <a><code>mouseup</code></a>, and <a><code>click</code></a> events (in that order) at the location
        of the <a><code>touchend</code></a> event for the corresponding touch input. If the
        contents of the document have changed during processing of the touch
        events, then the user agent may dispatch the mouse events to a
        different target than the touch events.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default actions and ordering of any further touch and mouse events
        are implementation-defined, except as specified elsewhere.
      </p>

      <section class="note">
      <p>The activation of an element (e.g., in some implementations, a tap)
      would typically produce the following event sequence
