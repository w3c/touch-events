    <section id='abstract'>
      The Touch Events specification defines a set of low-level events that
      represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface,
      and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM
      elements displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it
      (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays).  It also addresses
      pen-tablet devices, such as drawing tablets, with consideration toward
      stylus capabilities.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        User Agents that run on terminals which provide touch input to use web
        applications typically use interpreted mouse events to allow users
        to access interactive web applications. However, these interpreted
        events, being normalized data based on the physical touch input, tend
        to have limitations on delivering the intended user experience.
        Additionally, it is not possible to handle concurrent input regardless
        of device capability, due to constraints of mouse events: both
        system level limitations and legacy compatibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, native applications are capable of handling both cases with
        the provided system APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Touch Events specification provides a solution to this problem by
        specifying interfaces to allow web applications to directly handle touch
        events, and multiple touch points for capable devices.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        The W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">
        Protocols and Formats Working Group</a> created a non-normative document 
        that includes a mapping of hardware events (e.g. keyboard events) to touch 
        events. For more information see

      </p>

      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in

        this specification uses that specification and terminology.

       <h2>TouchEvent Implementer's Note</h2>

        <p>User agents should ensure that all <a>Touch</a> objects available from a given 
        <a>TouchEvent</a> are all associated to the same document that the <a>TouchEvent</a> was dispatched 
        to. To implement this, user agents should maintain a notion of the current 
        <em>touch-active</em> document. On first touch, this is set to the target document 
        where the touch was created. When all active touch points are released, the 
        <em>touch-active</em> document is cleared. All <a>TouchEvent</a>s are dispatched to the 
        current <em>touch-active</em> document, and each <a>Touch</a> object it contains refers 
        only to DOM elements (and co-ordinates) in that document. If a touch starts entirely 
        outside the currently <em>touch-active</em> document, then it is ignored entirely. </p>

                This example demonstrates the utility of changedTouches and it's relation
                with the other <a>TouchList</a> members of the <a>TouchEvent</a> interface.
                The code is a example which triggers whenever a touch point is removed
                from the defined touchable element:
              </p>

                  &lt;div id='touchable'&gt;
                      This element is touchable.
                  &lt;/div&gt;
              
                  document.getElementById('touchable').addEventListener('touchend', function(ev) {

                      /**

                       * two of them being on the "touchable" element and one point
                       * in the "touchable" element is lifted from the surface:
                       *
                       * Touch points removed: 1
                       * Touch points left on element: 1
                       * Touch points left on document: 2
                       */

                      document.write('Removed: ' + ev.changedTouches.length);
                      document.write('Remaining on element: ' + ev.targetTouches.length);
                      document.write('Remaining on document: ' + ev.touches.length);

        event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when the user
          places a <a>touch point</a> on the touch surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The target of this event must be an <a>Element</a>.  If the touch
          point is within a frame, the event should be dispatched to an element
          in the <a>child browsing context</a> of that frame.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the <a>preventDefault</a> method is called on this event, it
          should prevent any default actions caused by any touch events
          associated with the same <a>active touch point</a>, including mouse
          events or scrolling.

        <h3 id="event-touchend">The <dfn class="event">touchend</dfn> event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when the user
          removes a <a>touch point</a> from the touch surface, also including
          cases where the touch point physically leaves the touch surface, such
          as being dragged off of the screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>target</a> of this event must be the same <a>Element</a> on 
		  which the <a>touch point</a> started when it was first
          placed on the surface, even if the <a>touch point</a> has since moved
          outside the interactive area of the <a>target</a> element.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>touch point</a> or points that were removed must be included
          in the <a>changedTouches</a> attribute of the <a>TouchEvent</a>, and
          must not be included in the <a>touches</a> and <a>targetTouches</a>
          attributes.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="event-touchmove">The <dfn class="event">touchmove</dfn> event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when the user
          moves a <a>touch point</a> along the touch surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>target</a> of this event must be the same <a>Element</a> on 
		  which the <a>touch point</a> started when it was first
          placed on the surface, even if the <a>touch point</a> has since moved
          outside the interactive area of the <a>target</a> element.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that the rate at which the user agent sends <a>touchmove</a>
          events is implementation-defined, and may depend on hardware
          capabilities and other implementation details.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the <a>preventDefault</a> method is called on the <em>first</em>
          <a>touchmove</a> event of an <a>active touch point</a>, it should
          prevent any default action caused by any <a>touchmove</a> event
          associated with the same <a>active touch point</a>, such as scrolling.

        <h3 id="event-touchcancel">The <dfn class="event">touchcancel</dfn> event</h3>
        <p>
          A user agent must dispatch this event type to indicate when a touch
          point has been disrupted in an implementation-specific manner, such as
          a synchronous event or action originating from the UA canceling the
          touch, or the touch point leaving the document window into a
          non-document area which is capable of handling user interactions.
          (e.g. The UA's native user interface, plug-ins)  A user agent may
          also dispatch this event type when the user places more <a>touch
          point</a>s on the touch surface than the device or implementation is
          configured to store, in which case the earliest <a>Touch</a> object
          in the <a>TouchList</a> should be removed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>target</a> of this event must be the same <a>Element</a> on 
		  which the <a>touch point</a> started when it was first
          placed on the surface, even if the <a>touch point</a> has since moved
          outside the interactive area of the <a>target</a> element.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a>touch point</a> or points that were removed must be included
          in the <a>changedTouches</a> attribute of the <a>TouchEvent</a>, and
          must not be included in the <a>touches</a> and <a>targetTouches</a>

      <h2>Interaction with Mouse Events</h2>
      <p>
        The user agent may dispatch both touch events and mouse events
        [[!DOM-LEVEL-2-EVENTS]] in response to the same user input.  If the
        user agent dispatches both touch events and mouse events in response to
        a single user action, then the <a>touchstart</a> event type must be
        dispatched before any mouse event types for that action.  If the
        <a>preventDefault</a> method of <a>touchstart</a> or <a>touchmove</a>
        is called, the user agent should not dispatch any mouse event that
        would be a consequential result of the the prevented touch event.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If a Web application can process touch events, it can intercept them, 
        and no corresponding mouse events would need to be dispatched by the 
        user agent. If the Web application is not specifically written for 
        touch input devices, it can react to the subsequent mouse events instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the user agent intreprets a sequence of touch events as a click,
        then it should dispatch <a>mousemove</a>, <a>mousedown</a>,
        <a>mouseup</a>, and <a>click</a> events (in that order) at the location
        of the <a>touchend</a> event for the corresponding touch input.  If the
        contents of the document have changed during processing of the touch
        events, then the user agent may dispatch the mouse events to a
        different target than the touch events.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default actions and ordering of any further touch and mouse events
        are implementation-defined, except as specified elsewhere.

      <h2>Glossary</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>active touch point</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A <a>touch point</a> which is currently on the screen and is being
          tracked by the user agent.  The touch point becomes active when the
          user agent first dispatches a <a>touchstart</a> event indicating its
          appearance.  It ceases to be active after the user agent dispatches a
          <a>touchend</a> or <a>touchcancel</a> event indicating that the touch
          point is removed from the surface or no longer tracked.
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn>touch point</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          The coordinate point at which a pointer (e.g finger or stylus)
          intersects the target surface of an interface.  This may apply to a
          finger touching a touch-screen, or an digital pen writing on a piece
          of paper.
        </dd>
        
        <dt><dfn>preventDefault</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          If a event is cancelable, the preventDefault method is used to signify
          that the event is to be canceled, and any default actions defined in the
          user agent as a result of this event, or consequential events from the
          canceled event will not occur. Calling this method on non-cancelable
          events will have no effect.
